= Who's Home Application

This project is an extension of an awesome project [1] that was originally put
together for Raspberry Pi. We have modified it to run in a docker container
that will eventually feed into a physical Raspberry Pi device.

== Objective
Our objective is to demonstrate the software development lifecycle using docker
and OpenShift for doing development that is orchestrated by a CI/CD tool for
testing and deploying onto a physical Raspberry Pi device.
